SDK is autogenerated. To generate it, call `yarn generate:sdk`.
Compiling TS SDK to JavaScript is possible but disabled right now (to enable, remove "noEmit" from `generated_tsconfig.json`).

Directories and files:
- `src` source of the SDK generator (in Typescript)
- `dist` target for SDK generator JavaScript files (so it can be used with Node)
- `generated_ts` generated SDK Typescript files
- `out` generated SDK JavaScript files (disabled)
- `input` modules that don't need to be generated and are just copied
